I am using a late day for this assignment. It's more than a day late because I was waiting for a response on Discord.

References:
  1. Worked with Aubrey Sine on Code Structure
  2. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24102157/seeking-an-exit-equivalent-in-swift
  3. Book Chapter 3 - 14

To do:
  1. Read files in correctly. This way I won't need to hardcode some passwords
  2. Get the decrypt function working. My encrypt is working but I can't implement it without having a working decrypt
  3. File loading to work correctly
